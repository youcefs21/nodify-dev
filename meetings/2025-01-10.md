## Notes

TODO:

- Convert vscode python lang server info into json format we had before
  - get ranges of func defs, id them, put refs to them
  - goal: get json structure similar to what we had before, but using vscodes references/file paths/definitions
    - when we call a func, vscode knows where its defined, no need to preload into a scope buffer
    - vscode also handles imports for us too
    - clean up structure, just needs to be graphable, write some tests for it
- After nice clean json, need vscode webview of the graph
  - Some way to get to the location on the graph via like ctrl click hotkey (as if you were trying to find the references)
    - Or use codelens to have some text show on top of funcs, classes, etc
    - That becomes the start point in the graph
  - Json format should be ez to graph, contain all info we need
- Collect LLM responses
  - build a graph view where it gives you two options and you pick the better one - to "train" the model
- Other abstraction levels...
