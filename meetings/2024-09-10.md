# Meeting with Dr. Moradi and Visual Debugger Discussion

Attendees:

- Ahmet Dumlu
- Anthony Hunt
- Mutaz Helal
- Youcef Boumar

Duration: 8:30 am - 10:00 am

## Notes

- Discuss ast visualizer with Dr. Moradi

### Visual Debugger Features

#### P0

- static analysis of code in graph form
- ability to run graph generator without running code
- visual form of documentation
  - focus on data flow
  - graphs always up to date (run our graph analysis every time the file/proj is saved)

#### P1

- interact with AST
  - get general overview of project, focused on current open file
  - no changes to AST from the graph through, just the ability to view it from different perspectives
- make vscode extension
  - graph appears in new window
  - updates on save

#### P2

- mark breakpoints or provide a hotkey to zoom in to that place on the graph
- create custom views that focus on a start and end point
  - group nodes to form a view
  - each view tells a story about a specific component of your system
  - run test data through these views, inspect the in/out of each node
  - vscode tells how many views a function is part of

#### P3

- combine with other doc tools (like pydoctor)
  - need to make sure the doc tool does not need to run code
- reorganize code through the graph
- add other languages
- train a model for good abstractions of the graph (to address the major problem)
- visualize multithreading or async
- make a debugger for it
  - visualize python objects and where they are defined (in terms of types and attributes)
  - useful for error handling? null catching? differences between expected/actual type?
- encourage good programming practices by producing clearer visualizations when followed

### Stakeholders

- advanced users of a large (open-source) project
  - quickly see the architecture of the project (which modules exist, general function)
- developers/contributors on large projects
  - see how a change affects the flow of execution and data
  - help QA find the function causing bugs, provide more detailed bug reports
  - especially good for people new to a project
- really good for demoing code to new developers - "guided tours" from CodeSee
  - good for an experienced dev to show the codebase to a new dev
  - represent and document important flows

### Purpose

- provide transparency of the AST/order of function calls
- make unit tests easier through visualizing function flow
  - better understand coverage
- looking at code when new to a project gives a lot of implementation details you dont really care about
- often times we have had to make graphs (by hand) to show other members on our team the flow of execution
- manual flow charts become outdated quickly, no one updates them once they are made, no attachment to the code
  - semantic analysis of the code itself will never be out of date
  - saves time instead of going into code base and making flow charts yourself
  - documentation attached to/based off the code itself

### Problems

- too much/too little detail in the graph
  - eg. CodeSee is similar but can be hard to read
  - Soln: allow for different levels of detail
    - should be able to group and hide details
- excels at data oriented programs rather than technical algos

### Next Steps

- first package to analyze: pydantic
- use pydantic's core_schema functions as an example of a problem, and a case study to solve that problem
  - make the flow chart for it
- find more cases where this tool is useful
