## Notes

- Rework SRS

Good documentation is crucial for effective interaction with large codebases, whether as a user, contributor, or maintainer. Without documentation, users would need to read the source code to figure out how to use the project, and maintainers would need to remember every detail of every component they work on. At some point in a software project's lifetime, maintaining good documentation becomes a task just as challenging and time-consuming as maintaining the project itself. Tools like API documentation generators help, but still rely on active contributions and following specific styles.
