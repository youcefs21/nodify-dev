# Meeting with Mehrdad

Attendees:

- Ahmet Dumlu
- Anthony Hunt
- Mutaz Helal
- Youcef Boumar

Duration: 9:00 am - 11:30 am

## Notes

Usefulness

- need to think about level of abstractions
- use LLM to keep descriptions of functions up-to-date in more abstract views of the graph

Afterward

- partition pieces of code when making detailed view using an LLM
  - by default just "section off" parts of code so theres not too many nodes in a large graph
  - color diff parts of the code

Two major parts of the project

- documentation generator, static analysis of code
- then add telemetry when code is running in production

General plan

- decide how different views (levels of abstractions) look
- parsing code ast
  - handle every aspect of the python AST
  - all scopes (every indent is a scope)

---

- should automatically detect the "busy-ness" of the graph, or have everything collapsed by default
- sequential is stacked blocks, scopes/calls get arrows
- parallelization should have a special type of arrow, but they get their own blocks
- same sort of exploration as seeing a new code base, but can visualize the code all at once without having to keep it in your head

PoC

- can split code
- can graph code

### Different types of blocks in Python

- statements
- conditionals
- loops
- recursion
- imports
- return/yield
- functions
- classes
- context block (`with` keyword)
- try-catch
- match
- assert
- decorators
- concurrency
  - async/await
  - threading
  - multiprocessing
- type statements?
- lambda/anonymous functions
