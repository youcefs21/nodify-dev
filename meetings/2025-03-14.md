# Meeting with prof and TA

- make sure u give value
- show the process - break down code, pass to AI
- have a small digestible script for the demo
  - maybe a simple ML model?
- need to emphasize that it works for any piece of python code
- LLM doesnt generate code from text prompts tho
  - future work, take in a prompt from each box
- need to demonstrate value, people dont like to look at code
- enable both local and server for llm
- what metrics are we targeting? compare the two models (cost vs performance)
  - would make it a little more scientific
  - what are we improving
    - maybe survey, A/B testing in real world
    - see impact on devs
    - measure change in productivity before/after (not realistic)
- need to make sure we explain it better, give it a storyline
- check with large code base
  - see how well it can perform
  - its fine if no solid metric, but need to help verify
  - see where it gets stuck/limitations

# Demo Ideas

- maybe interview a couple CS students and gauge their reaction?
- Apple keynote-like idea?
- Give a storyline/example?
- Need to convince people of the product
